<h2>Hello!</h2>

I'm Penny, 

I have just started my journey into tech and have recently graduated at School of Code Bootcamp Spring 2022 🚀.

I have learnt about Fullstack applications and dabbled into the frontend with HTML, JS, CSS, React and learnt about the backend with Express, Postgres and SQL.

My portfolio can be found  <a href="https://penny-luc.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here <a> 👩🏻‍💻.
  
Feel free to check out some of my projects below! ✨
